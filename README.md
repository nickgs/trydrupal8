Try Drupal 8 Frontend
==========

This is the second iteration of the Try Drupal8 site. We learned alot from our first version.

This is a simple AngularJS front end which calls a service to spin a Drupal 8 instance. This repo also serves this frontend.

If you have any suggestions or find any bugs please submit a pull request or an issue.
